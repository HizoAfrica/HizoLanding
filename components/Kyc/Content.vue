      <p>
        Hizo is dedicated to establishing and upholding effective internal
        controls to halt money laundering and terrorist funding schemes. The
        company has a zero-tolerance policy for these behaviors and is required
        to abide by the pertinent regulations aimed to prevent anti-money
        laundering and countering terrorism financing (commonly known as
        "AML/CTF"). These regulations include the Money Laundering (Prevention
        and Prohibition) Act of 2022 and AML/CFT guidelines. This policy
        outlines Hizo's obligations regarding adhering to, complying with, and
        upholding anti-money laundering ("AML") and counter-terrorist financing
        ("CFT") laws. It also provides information and guidance to all Hizo
        employees, including contractors, vendors, donors, users, beneficiaries,
        and business partners, on how to identify and address any potential
        money laundering/terrorist financing issues if they arise. This Policy
        might be modified occasionally to reflect changes to the laws and rules
        it is based on.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>
        Money laundering is the process of converting money or other assets
        (criminal property) obtained through criminal activity into "clean"
        money or other assets with no overt sign of their illicit origins. Any
        type of asset can be considered criminal property, including cash or its
        equivalents, securities, physical products, and intangible assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Terrorism financing is providing, depositing, distributing, or
        collecting money directly or indirectly with the knowledge that it would
        be used entirely or in part to finance terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The AML/CFT Policy of the Company is targeted at preventing and
        detecting money laundering and the financing of terrorism, as well as
        any activity that facilitates them, in accordance with all applicable
        legal and regulatory requirements. This general policy document applies
        to all services provided by the Company and to all Customers of these
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The AML/CFT Policy defines the Company's identification and surveillance
        procedures, the procedures for integrating new Customers and monitoring
        existing Customers, the CDD tools, the methods for assessing risks,
        monitoring transactions, and reporting unusual or suspicious activities,
        the asset freezing system, the procedures set out for the Documents
        archiving, the means of ensuring ongoing training of the key personnel
        and the internal control system.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to this internal policy, the AML/CFT system of the Company
        includes a Risk Assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
        All those who fit into the following groups are seen to be particularly
        vulnerable to engaging in money laundering and/or financing terrorism:
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs);</li>
        <li>Participation in an organized criminal group and racketeering;</li>

      <h2>Our Policy</h2>
      <h3>ML-TF Mitigating Measures</h3>
      <p>
        The characteristics of the Services limit their exposure to ML/FT risks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Company offers controlled account deposit methods (virtual account
          numbers and card funding);
        </li>
        <li>
          The Company does not offer any type of digital assets deposits; this
          eliminates the risk of the Service being used for smurfing purposes;
        </li>
        <li>
          The Company only accepts payments via bank tranfers or cards using
          secured 3D payment gateways (limiting the risk of funds being placed
          from fraudulent sources).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, the Service remains vulnerable to certain ML/FT attempts,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Placement: introducing illicit funds into the system - it may involve
          splitting funds using provided virtual account number(s);
        </li>
        <li>
          Terrorism financing: Creating multiple accounts for the sole purpose
          of receiving and sending to finance terrorist-related activities
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Customer Due Diligence -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Customer Due Diligence</h2>
      <p>
        Given the nature of the services, to carry out proper customer due
        diligence, Hizo will implement policies and procedures in its Lines of
        Business (LOBs), recognizing and validating the customer’s identity
        using thefollowing "Know Your Customer" principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The identification and verification of the Customer's identity and,
          where applicable, the Ultimate Beneficial owners (hereinafter the "
          UBO "); and;
        </li>
        <li>
          Information on the donors, businesses, vendors, beneficiaries, and
          customers that was gathered from dependable and impartial sources
          (“Identity verification”).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Customers (donors, businesses vendors, and users) who are classified as
        Listed Companies or Public Authorities and who, as a result of their
        regulated activities, present a lower risk of engaging in money
        laundering and terrorist activity can typically benefit from the
        implementation of a streamlined customer due diligence process thanks to
        Hizo's AML/CFT processes and procedures. Customers who are Small and
        Medium-sized Businesses (SMB), which could not be Listed Companies, and
        those who use Hizo will be subject to further checks and due diligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same vein, an individual who uses Hizo at any levels will be
        subject to further checks and due diligence. If there is any suspicious
        activity throughout the customer engagement or due diligence process, it
        should be reported right away to the designated support contact
        hello@hizo.africa
      </p>
    </div>
    <!-- Customer Due Diligence end-->

    <!-- Risk-Based Approach -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Risk-Based Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Compliance with these obligations is modulated according to a risk-based
        approach, based on the Risk Assessment and Risk Scoring of the Customer.
        According to Hizo, a customer's country of residence or the type of
        activities they engage in directly influences their likelihood of
        becoming involved in money laundering and terrorist funding schemes.
        Hizo will group its customers according to their risk level using the
        pertinent line of business processes and procedures. The identification
        of potential risks will aid in successful risk management by
        implementing measures to lower any recognized risks. Changes in a User's
        circumstances like the ones listed below may be viewed suspiciously.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Unusual transactions that are inconsistent with the customer's
          recognized business activities;
        </li>
        <li>A sudden rise in business activities from an existing Customer;</li>
        <li>Peak periods of activity at specific times or locations;</li>
        <li>
          Having multiple accounts with large funds from unverifiable source(s);
        </li>
        <li>Unfamiliar or untypical types of customers or transaction;</li>
        <li>Situations where the source of funds cannot be easily verified;</li>
        <li>
          Complex transactions and unusual transactional patterns with no
          discernible economic or legal reason;
        </li>
        <li>
          Funds sent or received from regions with a history of terrorism or
          high levels of crime.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Customer KYC -->
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Preventing financial fraud, money laundering, financing of terrorism,
        and other forms of identity theft is crucial to the functioning of Hizo.
        As a result, we have put in place a stringent Know Your Customer (KYC)
        procedure that complies with international best practices. In addition,
        we keep up the KYC procedure with our customers once a good working
        relationship has been established. Since we expect customers to update
        their contact and identification details whenever they change.
      </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)</h2>
      <p>
        PEPs are people designated by their governments to perform a public
        obligation on their behalf. They may so represent high-risk customers
        because they have been given access to substantial public monies
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, they may engage in corrupt activities that have ties to AML
        and CFT due to their position of authority.
      </p>
      <p>PEPs can be (but are not limited to the following):</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Senior Officials in Governmental Positions</li>
        <li>Ministry Appointed Positions</li>
        <li>Politicians</li>
        <li>Family members / Close friends of the aforementioned</li>
        <li>Senior Military Officials</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Hizo will make sure that the Hizo account(s) where these monies are
        deposited are immediately restricted limiting every form of account
        transactions if any suspicious transactions are detected as linked to a
        PEP with the assistance of our partners. Therefore, we rely largely on
        the assistance of Banks and any of our partners to report any suspicious
        activity. To prevent PEPs from participating in a transaction, we also
        abide by local and international regulations. We have therefore put in
        place various measures such as:
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Setting transaction limits</li>
        <li>Record keeping</li>

        Hizo expects that, if any employee, contractor, or business partner
        becomes aware of any suspicion or knowledge of possible AML/CFT
        activity, this is to be reported without undue delay to our designated
        support, hello@hizo.africa
      </p>
      <p>
        The following details, which will be verified, should be included at the
        very least in a report on suspicious activity:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identity of the person raising the suspicion;</li>
        <li>Date of the report;</li>
        <li>Date of the report;</li>

        suspicions. Details of internal reports will be held separately, and
        excluded from customer files, to avoid inadvertent or inappropriate

        The MLRO is the sole decision-maker and the only person authorised to
        file a SAR. In urgent cases, and if the MLRO is unavailable, any Officer
        or, failing that, any employee of the Company trained according to an
        emergency procedure, may take the initiative to report suspicions when
        the analysis of the Alert justifies it.

      <p>
        Customer information will be electronically kept. It is necessary to
        keep an appropriate record of the paperwork that has been received, the
        actions that have been taken, and copies or references to the customers
        documents. Records will be kept for the duration of the connection with
        the customer and a minimum of five (5) years after the relationship
        ends, in compliance with section 8 of the Money Laundering (Prevention
        and Prohibition) Act, 2022. In countries where this duration exceeds the
        allowed time limit, the legally required timeframe will be taken into
        account to comply with local laws.

        directly from such a SAR or disclosure, the National Authority or Agency
        shall be liable for the damage suffered. These provisions shall also

        All transactions are kept track of by a centralized monitoring system

        employs cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
        algorithms in real-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system recognises high-risk transactions and recognizes potentially
        suspicious transactions using predefined criteria and scenarios. As soon
        as a suspicious transaction is discovered, emails and alerts are
        forwarded to the MLRO and management team. The alerts are examined in
        accordance with the discovered rule. The alerts are looked into using
        the AML standards under which the transaction was found. If necessary,
        the issue would be resolved or escalated to include other pertinent
        parties
